# How does GitHub Actions automate development tasks?
Here, we introduce GitHub Actions and workflows. You learn the types of actions you can use and where to find them. You also look at examples of these types of actions and how they fit in a workflow.
## GitHub decreases time from idea to deployment
GitHub is designed to help teams of developers and DevOps engineers build and deploy applications quickly. There are many features in GitHub that enable these efficiencies, but they generally fall into one of two categories:
- Communication: Consider all of the ways that GitHub makes it easy for a team of developers to communicate about the software development project: code reviews in pull requests, GitHub issues, project boards, wikis, notifications, and so on.
- Automation: GitHub Actions lets your team automate workflows at every step in the software-development process, from integration to delivery to deployment. It even lets you automate adding labels to pull requests and checking for stale issues and pull requests.
When combined, these features have allowed thousands of development teams to effectively decrease the amount of time it takes from their initial idea to deployment.
